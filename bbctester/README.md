# Black-Box Compiler Tester library (Bbctester)

This directory contains a few helper functions to parse test files (see below for the format) and generate unit-tests for alcotest. The main entrypoint of the library is the following function (see also the example in `bin/test.ml`)

```ocaml
(* Given the path of a C runtime file [runtime], a [compiler] and
  the path [dir] of a directory containing tests files, produces 
  unit tests for each test files in [dir]  *)
val tests_from_dir : 
  runtime:string ->
  compiler:compiler ->
  ?interpreter:(string -> string) ->
  string -> (string * unit Alcotest.test_case list) list

```


# Tests files (*.test)

A test file contains both a source program to be fed to the compiler and various metadata to help testing the compiler.
Here is how it looks like:
```
NAME: add1
DESCRIPTION: increments a number

SRC:
(add1 20)

EXPECTED:
21
```


It uses the extension `.test` and is composed of a few sections that appear in the following order:
- `NAME:` [optional, default empty] : the name of the test
- `DESCRIPTION:` [optional, default empty] : a longer description of the content of the test
- `PARAMS:` [optional, default empty] : a `,`-separated list of pairs `VAR=VAL` that are adde to the environment variables of the compiled executable
- `STATUS:` [optional, default `No error`] : either `CT error` (compile time error), `RT error` (runtime error) or `No error`/ Needs to be set to the appropriate error if the program is expected to fail either at compile time or at runtime. In that case the content of `EXPECTED:` is interpreted as a pattern (see [Str](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Str.html)) matched against the output of the failing phase.
- `SRC:` : the source of the program def to the compiler
- `EXPECTED:` : the expected result of the program (note that debugging messages starting by `|` are ignored and shouldn't be part of the expected result). If the expected result ends with the message `|INTERPRET` then the expected result is obtained by subsituting `|INTERPRET` with the result of evaluating the interpreter on the source code.
